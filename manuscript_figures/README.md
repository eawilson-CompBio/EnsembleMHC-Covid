# recreate figures from the manuscript

This directory is primiarily for recreating the manuscript figures. As a general rule of thumb, generate the main text figures before the SI figures. In order to run the scripts properly, paths will need to be change in the header of each script.


## note

some of the datasets needed to recreate the results are too large to store on github.

* generate_figure_1.R
